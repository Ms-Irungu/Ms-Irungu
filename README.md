# 👋 Hi there, I'm Valentine Irungu

🌍 Passionate about building impactful, **location-driven** web applications that solve real-world problems.  
💻 A **Frontend Developer** & **GIS Enthusiast** focused on creating interactive, responsive, and beautiful user interfaces using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and geospatial tools.  
🗺️ My journey into **software development** began in December with **ALX**, and since then, I’ve been crafting solutions that blend **tech** and **geospatial data** to serve communities.  
🧭 Creator of **Pata Places**, a smart locator app built with ❤️, leveraging the **OpenStreetMap Overpass API** and **Nominatim Geocoder**.   
✨ I believe in **solution-based development** over complexity—keep it simple, useful, and impactful.
